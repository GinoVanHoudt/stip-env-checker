# How to install the Chrome extension locally?
### Using the .zip file (for most users)
1. download the .zip file from https://github.com/GinoVanHoudt/stip-env-checker/blob/main/stip-env-checker.zip
2. extract the .zip file 
3. in Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. drag and drop the extracted folder into the extensions page 
5. the extension should now be installed and ready to use!

### Using the local files (for developers)
1. in Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. enable `developer mode` (top right corner)
3. click on `load unpacked` (top left corner)
4. select the root folder of this project (where the manifest.json file is located)
5. the extension should now be installed and ready to use!
6. click the refresh icon on the extension card to reload the latest changes you made in the code

## Future improvements
_(If I find the time for it)_
- easy enable/disable the extension through the extension icon
- publish extension to the public Chrome web store
- color picker to customize the background color of the header banner
- instead of changing header banner color, change the theme of the app
- enable/disable dark mode?
